This package consists of several utilities to make Redis easier and more consistent in Go.

## pubsub

Tranditional Redis libraries allow you to subscribe to events, and maybe even pool connections. But there's often no mechanism for maintaining subscribed state in the event of a connection failure, and many packages aren't thread-safe. This package, `redutil/pubsub`, solves these issues.

It is fully thread safe and unit tested. We're currently using it in production, though it has not yet been entirely battle-tested. Feel free to open issues on this repository.

```go
package main

import (
    "time"
    "github.com/watchbeam/redutil/pubsub"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new pubsub client. This will create and manage connections,
    // even if you disconnect.
    c := pubsub.New(pubsub.ConnectionParam{
        Address: "127.0.0.1:6379",
        // optional password
        Password: "secret",
    })
    go client.Connect()
    defer c.TearDown()

    go listenChannel(c)
    go listenPattern(c)

    // Wait forever!
    select {}
}


// Simple example function that listens for all events broadcast
// in the channel "chan".
func listenChannel(c *pubsub.Client) {
    listener := c.Listen(pubsub.Channel, "chan")
    defer listener.Unsubscribe()
    for _, message := range listener.Messages {
        doStuff()
    }
}

// Example that listens for events that match the pattern
// "foo:*:bar". Note that we listen to the `PMessages` channel, not `Messages`.
func listenPattern(c *pubsub.Client) {
    listener := c.Listen(pubsub.Pattern, "foo:*:bar")
    defer listener.Unsubscribe()

    for _, message := range listener.PMessages {
        // You got mail!
    }
}
```
